# Pomodoro Timer

I built this project as part of my FreeCodeCamp.org [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/chriscolley/front-end-development-libraries).

Technology used:
- React js
- Styled Components

The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity system to avoid procrastination or getting distracted, allowing focus on getting stuff done. The idea is simple: set a timer for 25 minutes, work until it runs out, then take a 5-minute break â€” then repeat three more times. After that, take a 15- to 30-minute break.

In this web app the session and break time can be adjusted to suit the user. An alarm sounds at the end of the work session and break.

Please see my [DEMO](https://cscolley.github.io/pomodoro-timer/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
