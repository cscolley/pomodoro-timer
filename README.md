# Pomodoro Timer

I built this project as part of my FreeCodeCamp.org Front EndDevelopment Libraries Certification.

Technology used:
- React js
- Styled Components

The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity system to avoid procrastination or getting distracted, allowing focus on getting stuff done. The idea is simple: set a timer for 25 minutes, work until it runs out, then take a 5-minute break â€” then repeat three more times. After that, take a 15- to 30-minute break.

In this web app the session and break time can be adjusted to suit the user. An alarm sounds at the end of the work session and break.
